# GymBeam Data Hackathon 2024
## 25. - 27. 10. 2024, Kosice
### Challenge topic - AI Healthy Lifestyle Advisor

The goal of the Data Hackathon is to develop an AI advisor for a healthy lifestyle. A tool that will provide users with personalized, science-based recommendations to improve health and fitness. The use of machine learning and scientific data analysis ensures the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendations, with the tool to be continuously optimised based on user feedback and new scientific findings. The advisor is intended to bring substantial added value to anyone looking for reliable and personalised advice on healthy living.

This hackathon connects technology with nutrition and a healthy lifestyle. As participants, you will work on innovative solutions that can improve the quality of life for the general public and promote healthy habits through modern technology and artificial intelligence.

The Hackathon offers you an inspiring and supportive environment to create new AI tools that can have a long-term positive impact on society.
Collection and analysis of scientific articles

NLP techniques can be used to analyse scientific articles and extract key information about supplementation, such as dosage and effects, allowing automated processing of large amounts of scientific texts. The system and outputs will be in Slovak language.


We have prepared a list of articles that you can use to create and train your AI system. These articles can be found in your git repository, where all the necessary materials are available for download:
- https://bitbucket.org/data-hackaton-2024/workspace/overview/

One of the key topics is data processing, for which you can use any custom platform or you can try the Keboola platform, which we have also integrated in GymBeam. Keboola is a comprehensive and accessible data processing platform that allows you to easily integrate and transform data from different sources. For this Data Hackathon you can use Keboola to:
- Automation of data flows
- Data cleansing and preprocessing
- Integration with other tools
- Connection to LLM (Large Language Models)
- Prototyping of data applications/chatbots


### Modelling and algorithms for recommendation
Based on user input and scientific studies (from literature, articles, etc.), your solution should leverage open source machine learning models and AI tools to analyze patterns in the data and generate personalized recommendations to users. You can try Google's AI platform, Vertex AI, which allows you to develop, deploy, and manage predictive models.

### Recommendations for fictitious personas - "test"
The goal is to develop effective AI solutions that will be able to provide personalized healthy lifestyle recommendations.

Based on input variables from the user and scientific research, the AI system will create a personalized recommendation. The model uses machine learning to analyze patterns in the data and provide the user with optimal recommendations that include the source publication from which the recommendation was drawn.

Explanation of the recommendation with a scientific basis: each recommendation should include a source, i.e. it is supported by a reference to the study or book that was used in the decision. This will ensure that recommendations are reliable and supported by scientific evidence.

An example of a scientific reference: "According to the XYZ study (2020), whey protein has been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis and when combined with creatine, leads to further muscle growth. The recommended dosage is 20-30 grams of whey protein and 5 grams of creatine per day."
That's why we've prepared an 'exam' to test your AI solution: 
You can find it in your git repository along with other materials needed for the GymBeam Data Hackathon
- https://bitbucket.org/data-hackaton-2024/workspace/overview/

One of the mandatory outputs of your work is a CSV file that will contain fields:
- Name of the person - for whom the recommendation is intended,
- Product - which the system recommends,
- Study - from which the system has drawn information,
- Dosage - appropriate for the product and persona,
- User text - additional description and rationale for the recommendation.

Please save the resulting file in the project folder, see. "Project Submission Folder".

### Automation based on new data
The AI advisor should be able to continuously update and optimize recommendations based on new scientific knowledge, changes in user data, and user feedback.

## Rules in a nutshell

### The course of the hackathon
Opening will be on Friday at 20:00 and closing on Sunday at 8:00.
Participants will have a place to work, access to the internet, refreshments, and access to mentors from Kebool and the field of artificial intelligence.

During the hackathon, participants will tackle real-world challenges focused on personalized diet, supplementation and healthy lifestyle recommendations.

### Mentoring and support
Each team will have the opportunity to consult their project with mentors. There will be experts from a variety of fields, including software development, data processing and artificial intelligence.
Mentoring will take the form of short workshops on Friday and individual consultations on Saturday.
Evaluation and selection criteria for the winners
Projects will be evaluated by a jury of experts

### Evaluation criteria:
Innovation: how unique and creative the solution is.
Practicality: the potential for real-world application.
Personalisation: the ability to adapt to the individual needs of the user. 
Technical implementation: the quality of the code, the use of technology and the approach to problem solving.
Presentation: clarity and clarity of presentation of results.

### Code and project rules
All code created during the hackathon must be original and must not be copied from other sources. The use of open source software is allowed as long as the terms of the license are followed.
During the hackathon, teams must upload their code to a platform such as git so that a panel of judges can assess the technical quality and progress of the work.

Teams must deliver the final tool, including the complete source code of the solution, within a specified time limit.
All results and project presentations must be submitted before the hackathon deadline, which will be set by the organizers - but no later than October 27, 2024 (Sunday) at 8:00 am.

### Mandatory output: 
Test solution: recommendations for fictitious personas
Each team must create output documentation with evaluation and recommendations for a set of fictitious users, which will be provided by the organisers at the start of the hackathon.
The final evaluation must include:

Recommending supplements: based on individual user profiles, the team must develop a list of appropriate supplements to help users achieve their health goals.

Dosage: each recommendation must contain precise dosage information (e.g. 20 grams of whey protein post-workout, 5 grams of creatine daily).
Literature source: each recommendation must be accompanied by references to scientific studies or publications that support the recommendation. These sources must be scientifically substantiated (e.g. PubMed, NIH).

## Example evaluation for fictitious personas:
### Input: 
man, 30 years, 80 kg, goal: increase in muscle mass, etc.
Output from AI recommendations:

Recommendation: Whey protein, Creatine
Dosage: 25g whey protein after each workout, 5g creatine daily
Literature sources: „Effect of whey protein on muscle protein synthesis in humans: An overview“ (PubMed ID: 123456); „Creatine supplementation and exercise performance: an updated meta-analysis“ (NIH ID: 234567).

### Presentation of the solution
At the end of the hackathon, each team must present their solution in the form of a demo or presentation.
The presentation should include:
An overview of the problem the team solved.
Description of the developed solution and its key features.
A demonstration of how the system works (e.g. a demo application, prototype or example recommendation).
Justification of the recommendation, citing scientific sources and references to the technologies used.
Each team will have 5 minutes to present.

### Component for project submission:
You can find your git repository for uploading your entire project.
Each team will have its own repository, which will contain the team name and the relevant files.
